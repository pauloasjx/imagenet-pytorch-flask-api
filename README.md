# imagenet-pytorch-flask-api



React client that uses an API that consumes an imagenet model (VGG16).

The idea is to predict the image class using deep learning. In this repository we use an already trained model using the dataset of the imagenet. The architecture used is VGG16, and the framework used is pytorch.
